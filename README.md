# CafeWifiMountainViews
A website that lists Cafes in Banff with a focus on WiFi and Socket Availability as well as Mountain Views.
Users can add new Cafes which will be automatically added to the SQLlite Database.
I used a template from Start Bootstrap (https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog) for the basic front-end design.
This is a work in progress.
The following changes are planned:
- add a contact form
- add an overview of cafes in list form
- add the option to sign up and login
- change that adding is only possible if signed in
- add a review and commenting function for signed in users
- add admin only functions (e.g. delete or change cafes)
- add RESTful API so other coders can use the data
