# CafeWifiMountainViews
A website that lists Cafes in Banff with a focus on WiFi and Socket Availability as well as Mountain Views.
Users can add new Cafes which will be automatically added to the SQLlite Database. Includes RESTful API for using the data as JSON.

I used a template from Start Bootstrap (https://startbootstrap.com/themes/clean-blog) for the front-end design, which also includes Java Script Code that is NOT mine! All code in main.py as well as the Jinja/Python Code in the html files was written by me. For the front-end I only changed the CSS code in the file static/css/clean-blog.min.css slightly and marked the code as mine.

This is a work in progress.
The following changes are planned:
- add the option to sign up and login
- add admin only functions (e.g. delete or change cafes)
